    <h1>Ways to find prime numbers using Python</h1>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>In this article I will discuss simple methods to find primes numbers. I know that my code is not optimised but the focus is on understanding the code instead of the fastest solution.</p>

    <h2>1. The basic definitions you should know</h2>
    <h3>1. What is division</h3>
    <p>Division is defined as <code>ax = b</code> for any integer <code>x</code>, then we say that <code>a</code> divides <code>b</code>, or <code>a|b</code>. Conversely, if <code>ax≠b</code>, then <code>a</code> does not divide <code>b</code>, or <code>a ∤ b</code>.</p>
    <p>Ie <code>3 x 2 = 6</code> where <code>a</code> is <code>3</code>, <code>x</code> is <code>2</code> and <code>b</code> is <code>6</code>. Hence <code>3</code> divides <code>6</code>.</p>

    <h3>2. What is a prime number</h3>
    <p>If an integer <code>p</code> has no divisor other than <code>1</code> and itself, else it is a composite number.</p>

    <h2>2. Ways to find if a number is prime</h2>
    <p>Properly defining the question: find if the integer <code>n</code> is prime.</p>

    <h3>1. Loop through each 2 to n-1</h3>
    <pre><code>def simple_prime_checker(n):
    for i in range(2, n-1): # 1 and the number itself are not checked because we are looking if there is another multiple
        if n % i == 0: 
            return False # if there is at one element that gives no remainder then the number is not prime
    return True
</code></pre>

    <h3>2. Loop through between 2 and sqrt of n</h3>
    <p>Why only up to sqrt n?</p>
    <p>If <code>n</code> can be expressed as a product of two integers <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> (i.e., <code>n=a×b</code>), then at least one of those integers must be less than or equal to <code>n</code>. This is because if both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> were greater than <code>n</code>, their product <code>a×b</code> would exceed <code>n</code>.</p>
    <pre><code>import math
def simple_prime_checker(n):
    n = float(n)
    for i in range(2, math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))): # 1 and the number itself are not checked because we are looking if there is another multiple
        if n % i == 0:
            return False # if there is at one element that gives no remainder then the number is not prime
    return True
</code></pre>

    <h3>3. Sieve of Eratosthenes</h3>
    <p>It marks all the multiples of all the prime numbers in the range as not being prime starting from 1. The numbers that are left are considered prime.</p>
    <pre><code>def sieve(n):
    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1) # the list represents that all the numbers are prime
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False # 0 and 1 are not prime

    for p in range(2, n):
        if is_prime[p]: # if the number is prime
            for multiple in range(p * p, n + 1, p): # mark all the multiples as False
                is_prime[multiple] = False

    primes = [p for p in range(n + 1) if is_prime[p]] # collect all the indices that are still True
    return primes

def is_it_prime(n): # checks if the number is a prime by checking the numbers given by the sieve
    primes = sieve(n)
    if n in primes:
        return True
    return False
</code></pre>
